Data of the experimet result: Overall myoelectric control


This capsule contains result data of the experimentï¼šoverall myoelectric control. The detailed descriptions lies in the article named as Task-Oriented-Human-Robot-Interaction-Control-of-a-Robotic-Glove-Utilizing-Forearm-Electromyography, which has been submitted to the Journal of Franklin Institute. We will update revelant informations as soon as poosible.



Result data was stored in the branch named results. Two video demonstrations of the overall task-oriented assistive myoelectric control of the hand exoskeleton can be found at https://youtu.be/a86H2Qwtki4 and https://youtu.be/A-YBdTYs2HY.
